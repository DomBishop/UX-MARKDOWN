## Change by Design

###### The new logo, designed by Naim Heerah:

Our task was to refresh a brand and give it a new direction, and we where given Guide Dogs UK as part of the brief.

### Research (Guide Dogs UK)

To start with, we needed to decide how we were going to redirect the brand of Guide Dogs UK. After exploring their existing branding online such as their website and social medias, I found that the initial branding of Guide Dogs UK left a lot to be desired. The first one being their website, while it was functional in terms of usability for the impaired with scalable text and colour alteration options, the aesthetic was boring and didn’t innovate. From looking at their social medias I gathered that there was no clear target audience. So then it was decided as a team we would target millennials with our new branding. I researched what should be implemented into our branding to meet what we were setting out to do, these are some of the sources I found:

- https://www.guidedogs.org.uk/microsites/guide-dogs-in-school/puppy-resources/how-can-a-guide-dog-change-a-life/how-are-guide-dogs-trained/
- https://www.newscred.com/wp-content/themes/newscred/assets/downloads/guide/NewsCred_Millennial_Mind.pdf
- https://insights.newscred.com/content-drives-millennial-brand-loyalty/
- https://insights.newscred.com/welcome-to-the-performance-era-of-content-marketing/
- http://www.thedrum.com/opinion/2017/07/31/which-brands-do-millennials-best

From the research done, I gathered a good insight into what Guide Dogs UK wanted to achieve as a brand. They want to support those who need guide dogs, but they also want to educate people about exactly what a guide dog does and why they’re an important cause to support. In addition I looked into research done on branding and marketing towards millennials. I found that in terms of a social media strategy, the content we share should be educational and short, and the best way to do that would be through infographics. And so we did produce an example infographic for the brand that aligned with this and the fact that our content needs to be compelling for it to meet its purpose.

### Guide Dogs UK new brand guidelines

To establish a set of guidelines for the brand, I had to examine how to express that as an item by looking at how other brands write and present theirs. From looking at them I knew what I needed to include in ours, such as the language we use and what fonts we use and in what context. Being a charity trying to help people, I established the guidelines language as something approachable, giving, and inspiring because I felt that was what was most relevant to the brands new direction we were giving it. The colour scheme was also redesigned to better fit our new modern aesthetic with lighter shades and colours that better complimented one and other. The colours used, like blue, help us express ourselves as something kind and open just by our appearance.

#### [These are the guidelines I used for reference](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12z96QLDipMYyboH7sVLNP2MrniwbZiiL/view?usp=sharing), and this is the end result:

## Photo Library

###### The new logo, designed by Ricardo Welch:

For this project we had to create an online photo library with a niche concept, and we decided we would go with fruit and vegetable photography with a Pop Art theme. The library's name is Froodle.

### Research (Froodle)

For our research we looked at photographers that were already doing food photography in a pop art style, these are the ones we found:

- [Joseph Maida](https://www.instagram.com/josephmaida/)
- [Maciek Jasik](https://www.instagram.com/mjasik/)
- [Aleksandra Kingo](http://aleksandrakingo.com/)

The key element in all of the photos we looked at was the manipulation of food to make it look fake intentionally, or edit it in such as way that at a glance a cauliflower looked like a raspberry. The photographers took this and tried to implement it into their photos, while us on web media tried to influence our design with it. On the subject of research influencing design, the research on millennials done for the rebrand was useful for us here because the plan was to share the same target audience:

- https://insights.newscred.com/content-drives-millennial-brand-loyalty/
- https://insights.newscred.com/welcome-to-the-performance-era-of-content-marketing/
- http://www.thedrum.com/opinion/2017/07/31/which-brands-do-millennials-best

With this research we had conducted, we could establish how to build some brand guidelines that understood the audience and concept of Froodle. And how to implement design and marketing strategies that engaged our target audience and brought them closer to the brand.

Through the research I conducted on pop art as a subject, I concluded that pop art is at its core, like most art, subjective. It is supposed to be subjective for an individual and at the same time be vivid and hard hitting. With this in mind, our branding should concentrate on making sure its the images that get people's attention. To do this, the branding should focus on being a canvas for the images by being black and white, and relying on the colour in the images themselves to give the brand life!

### Sketches

### Wireframes

These wireframes where just an initial concept of what the site could look like, they’re not really influenced by our research:

These are the final wireframes that influenced the final site based on our research and branding:
